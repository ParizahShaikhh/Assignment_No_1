// Question No.30:
// Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
// • If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
// • Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.
// Array of usernames
let userNames = ["admin", "sania", "dua", "laraib", "sumaira"];
// Loop through the array and print greetings
for (let username of userNames) {
    if (username === "admin") {
        console.log("Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?");
    }
