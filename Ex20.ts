// Question No.20:
// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.


// Define an array of famous mountains
let mountains = [
    "Mount Everest",
    "K2",
    "Kangchenjunga",
    "Lhotse",
    "Makalu",
    "Cho Oyu",
    "Nanga Parbat"
];

// Print the array of mountains
console.log("List of famous mountains:");
console.log(mountains);
